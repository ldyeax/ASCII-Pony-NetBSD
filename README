System Pony
-----------

systempony is a script which shows a pony and system information.
It can be installed system-wide using "make install" (PREFIX selects the
target directory).

The global config is found in $PREFIX/share/ascii-pony/systempony.conf,
(or ./systempony.conf if not installed), user config is in ~/.systempony.conf

Config Variables:
* PONY   : a pony identifier or "random",
           see "./systempony --list" for a list of identifiers
* INFO   : an array of system info to display, "./systempony -h" for a list
* FSTYPE : a file system type used to calculate disk usage (Uses df),
           if empty it will show the total.

Requirements:
    * lsb-release for Distro
    * lxc for Containers
    * bc for CPU_Usage

Generating Images
-----------------

The sources for each character are divided into a file for each color.
The file name is one of these eight colors, with an optional _bright suffix:
black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white.
See patsi/patsi-render.py --help for details on how the rendered files are
generated and more formats than the Makefile produces.
The makefile produces the following kinds of output:

* ANSI-Encoded Colored text
* Plain Text
* SVG
* PNG
* Shell script
* IRC-Encoded Colored text

Being a Python script, it requires Python in order to run.
Additional requirements will be installed using pip and virtualenv.

The makefile will compile the above formats in ./rendered.

You can cat the colored files on a terminal to see the fancy output (as long as
the terminal supports colors).

Some blank ponies and a template directory can be found inside the
directory /Generic

Installing as MOTD
------------------

### pam.d

Ensure /etc/pam.d/login has the following line:

    session    optional   pam_motd.so  motd=/run/motd.dynamic

Note it does not end with `noupdate`.

Then (for a single pony picture) copy one of the files under rendered/sh to 
/etc/update-motd.d with a name like 20-pony or something like that.

If instead you want to use systempony in the motd, first install it system-wide
(with `make install`), then create the appropriate script that would call it.
